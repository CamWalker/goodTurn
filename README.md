# goodTurn
This is a website for people to do good turns daily.

## To Do:
* Figure out if we want React or Angular. Craig votes for React.
  * If React, use React Create App: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
* Build front end. Use https://github.com/strangebnb/react-airbnb as a guide to what we want it to look like. Craig should work on this more with input from Cameron
* Build back end. (Node || PHP) + SQL (postgres??). Cameron decides and should probably work on this more with input from Craig.
